              tion also implies -depth. -help, --help Print a summary of the 
              command-line usage of find and exit.
       -ignore_readdir_race Normally, find will emit an error message when it fails to 
              stat a file.  If you give this option and a file is deleted between the 
              time find reads the name of the file from the directory and the time it 
              tries to stat the file, no error message will be issued.  This also 
              applies to files or directories whose names are given on the command line.  
              This option takes effect at the time the com‐ mand line is read, which 
              means that you cannot search one part of the filesys‐ tem with this option 
              on and part of it with this option off (if you need to do that, you will 
              need to issue two find commands instead, one with the option and one 
              without it). Furthermore, find with the -ignore_readdir_race option will 
              ignore errors of the -delete action in the case the file has disappeared 
              since the parent direc‐ tory was read: it will not output an error 
              diagnostic, and the return code of the -delete action will be true.
       -maxdepth levels -- points. -mount Don't descend directories on other 
       filesystems.  An alternate name for -xdev,
              for compatibility with some other versions of find. -noignore_readdir_race 
              Turns off the effect of -ignore_readdir_race.
       -noleaf Do not optimize by assuming that directories contain 2 fewer 
              subdirectories than their hard link count.  This option is needed when 
              searching filesystems that do not follow the Unix directory-link 
              convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS
-- modification of the file it points to is always used. -atime n File was last accessed 
              less than, more than or exactly n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out how 
              many 24-hour periods ago the file was last accessed, any fractional part 
              is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to have been ac‐ cessed at 
              least two days ago.
       -cmin n File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly n minutes 
              ago.
-- considered for a match with -name will never include a slash, so `-name a/b' will 
              never match anything (you probably need to use -path instead).  A warning 
              is issued if you try to do this, unless the environment variable 
              POSIXLY_COR‐ RECT is set.  The metacharacters (`*', `?', and `[]') match a 
              `.' at the start of the base name (this is a change in findutils-4.2.2; 
              see section STANDARDS CONFORMANCE below).  To ignore a directory and the 
              files under it, use -prune rather than checking every file in the tree; 
              see an example in the description of that action.  Braces are not 
              recognised as being special, despite the fact that some shells including 
              Bash imbue braces with a special meaning in shell patterns.  The filename 
              matching is performed with the use of the fnmatch(3) library function.  
              Don't forget to enclose the pattern in quotes in order to
-- the starting points you specified.  When testing a find command line that you later 
              intend to use with -delete, you should explicitly specify -depth in order 
              to avoid later surprises.  Because -delete implies -depth, you cannot 
              usefully use -prune and -delete together. Together with the 
              -ignore_readdir_race option, find will ignore errors of the -delete action 
              in the case the file has disappeared since the parent directory was read: 
              it will not output an error diagnostic, and the return code of the -delete 
              action will be true.
